CubeTrip
========

Experimenting with Scene Kit, Sprite Kit and Swift. This is a proof of concept for some visual ideas.

1) Cubes 
Some shapes created in at run-time & some shapes read in from a DAE file

2) Experimenting with multiple shapes & animating them.  Also using a Skybox.

3) Sprite Kit 

scrolling an sprite texture with a light; the texture is using a mask value
set in teh SK file.
