CubeTrip
========

This started out a experiment with using SceneKit to display some cubes; it is now doing more than that.  I keep adding new scenes as try things out.

Experimenting with Scene Kit, Sprite Kit and Swift. This is a proof of concept for some visual ideas.

1) Cubes 
Some shapes created in at run-time & some shapes read in from a DAE file

2) Experimenting with multiple shapes & animating them.  Also using a Skybox.

There is a sphere and a cube that are rotating using actions set up in the SceneKit scene file.

3) Sprite Kit 

This experiment shows a moving srite texture with a light node; the texture is using a mask value set in the SK scene file that matches the light node.
